However, with the help of REI, learning the basics will lead to a fun activity that is healthy physically and mentally.</p> <p>From the REI webpage:<br/>Join the 52 Hike Challenge Founders for a discussion on everything you need to know to get started backpacking and become inspired to change your life, one step at a time. Phillip was overweight and unhappy; to make a positive lifestyle change he took to the trails to get in shape, eventually losing and keeping off the weight by progressing his hiking capabilities. He has been an avid hiker and mountaineer over that past 15+ years and brings you his expertise and wisdom as you begin backpacking. After going through a difficult time in her life, Karla was inspired by Phillip to begin her own hiking journey; challenging herself to a hike per week as a means to get in shape. Once her challenge was complete, Karla couldn't believe the positive impact that the outdoors had on her life. She brings knowledge of 4+ years and her perspective on backpacking as a woman!</p> <p>The discussion will be from 6:30-7:30 followed by a reception from 7:30-8:30.</p> <p>You must register with REI to attend this event:<a href=\\\"https://www.rei.com/event/52-hike-challenge-intro-to-backpacking/burbank/205410\\\" class=\\\"linkified\\\">https://www.rei.com/event/52-hike-challenge-intro-to-backpacking/burbank/205410</a></p> <p>Please make sure you review a copy of the Outdoor Afro trip waiver so that we can start this activity on time<br/><a href=\\\"http://www.outdoorafro.com/outdoor-afro-trip-waiver_2017002_waiver/\\\" class=\\\"linkified\\\">http://www.outdoorafro.com/outdoor-afro-trip-waiver_2017002_waiver/</a></p> \",\"how_to_find_us\":\"Meet us in the front of the store.\",\"visibility\":\"public\"}]"
