From there we will hike up to the lodge together while I tell the group about the plants and wildlife. Once we get to the Minnekhada Lodge, I will hand out tools and explain how to safely use them. The group will pull out the invasive plants until 11:30am and then have a 30 minute lunch break. There will be a Clif bar supplied and some juice to drink. If you want more food, I recommend packing it. After lunch everyone will go back to pulling the invasive plants until 12:30pm. The tools will be cleaned up and the group will hike back to the Quarry Road parking lot.</p> <p>Email [masked] if you have any questions</p> \",\"how_to_find_us\":\"Meet at the parking lot and then we will hike up to the lodge\",\"visibility\":\"public\"}"
