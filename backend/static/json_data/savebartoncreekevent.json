Want to help shape the future of transportation here in central Texas? Come out to this month's Creek Crew Happy Hour to learn more about Project Connect: Capital Metro's vision for a high-capacity transit system in Central Texas. We will be hearing from Justin Henderson, who works with Capital Metro and is heavily involved with this project. Project Connect's goal is to connect people, places and opportunities through a complete, congestion-proof system of reliable and frequent high-capacity services like light rail, bus rapid transit (BRT) and emerging technologies \u2013 all running in dedicated lanes or on tracks, away from other traffic. <a href=\\\"https://www.capmetro.org/about-projectconnect/\\\" class=\\\"linkified\\\">https://www.capmetro.org/about-projectconnect/</a> Come learn about the multiple ways you can get involved with Project Connect and help shape the future of Austin's transportation along with SBCA at this educational event!</p> \",\"visibility\":\"public\"}"
