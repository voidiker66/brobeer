Leaving around 9:00 am<br/>Pete will lead a ride up to Wise mountain, Montezuma, Webster pass, radical hill and red cone pass. Some of the passes may be snowed in (most likely the top of Webster) and we will have to backtrack. This will be an advanced ride for experienced riders only.</p> <p>Directions:</p> <p>From Hwy 9: Approximately 1 mile north of the \"Round-About\" on the north edge of Breckenridge is a stop light for TIGER ROAD (NOT Tiger Run)</p> <p>1) Turn EAST on Tiger ROAD (aka Co Rd 6)<br/>2) Follow Tiger Road, past the golf course - it will turn to dirt.</p> <p>3) Start watching for CQR Signs. approx. 3 miles onto the dirt road, you will be making a LEFT turn on CR 354 (this road can be very rutted) If you go over the small bridge you HAVE GONE TOO FAR. travel in on this about 1 mile. There is a open space on the right, suitable for most rigs as well as some nice tenting spots. This area can fill up quickly on weekends, Please park your rig in a way that makes best use of the space available.</p> <p>GPS COORDINATES for the Camp Site:</p> <p>[masked], [masked]<br/>elevation 9950</p> <p>Camping: Camping is DRY with no facilities. There are Motels/Hotels in Breckenridge or Frisco and the closest gas is also in Breckenridge or Frisco. The camping area is small and often there are locals that camp there as well. So try to arrive early to secure a spot.</p> <p>Potluck: We will have a potluck Dinner Saturday night at 6:00 PM, if you wish to participate please bring something to share.</p> <p>Trail Width: No restrictions</p> <p>Ride: Trail Difficulty in this area ranges from intermediate to Difficult.<br/>Be prepared for all weather conditions. DOT APPROVED HELMETS ARE MANDATORY.</p> <p>Maps: National Geographic Trails Illustrated #130, 131, and 132 cover this area. Also, Charles Wells has a book of the area.</p> <p>Avenza MVUM maps..

Right before we were set to start, Veritas contacted Supervisor Peskin's office and said that if he did not attend the event, then Veritas would sit down and negotiate all pending O&amp;M passthroughs across the city. I spoke with Sup. Peskin's office about this decision, and Sup. Peskin decided to not attend to keep that option on the table while ensuring the press conference would still continue.</p> <p>That was a VICTORY for us, as it gave us new leverage to negotiate pending passthroughs for buildings that won't benefit from the legislation!</p> <p>Then, the Veritas lobbyist called Supervisor Fewer and begged us to call off the march to Greentree's office. Because of organizing this action, we suddenly gained leverage. I brought the issue to the tenants who were there, and tenants voted to continue with the press conference and march.</p> <p>As a result of this action, we got leverage to negotiate other buildings' pending passthroughs AND we saw what weakens Veritas: organized tenants, public action, and media exposure!</p> <p>For the legislation, it was introduced that day, April 3. We are now in a 30-day waiting period before it goes to committee for a public hearing. During this time, we need to talk with our supervisors. I'm going to send a separate email tomorrow with more info on this strategy and how to get involved, but for now, if you don't know your supervisor, please click HERE to type in your address and find your district number and supervisor.

(description &amp; links to examples below)</p> <p>----</p> <p>IGO - Improvisational Groove Orchestra</p> <p>We meet EVERY Thursday to listen, respond, observe and curiously play with the sounds our voices create together. Our objective is to tune into the common feeling we are developing in the present moment.</p> <p>Most of what we do is with our eyes closed. This allows everyone to be very focused on only the sound space without any other distractions.</p> <p>At each session we usually have more beginners rather than experienced singers; all levels and voice types are welcome. Scott will explain a few basic and intuitively understandable concepts to make it super easy to dive in and be jamming out within the first 15 minutes! It is a learning process in progress, each time balancing ourselves in volume and expression to merge into the group sound space, allowing everyone to hear and be heard, naturally developing our own musical styles.</p> <p>The last times we explored further into the human sequencer game – a system where one person acts as a conductor, splitting the group into small parts, giving each small group unique impulses that than develop into one composition.</p> <p>Feel most welcome to come and join us! (please be on time, there are important things to explain before beginning)</p> <p>** pay as you feel, 2 - 5€ after the session</p> <p>• You can find older tracks from previous IGO session in Das Baumhaus here: - • NEW! ---&gt; <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/das-baumhaus/sets/improvisational-groove-orchestra-baumhaus-23072017\" class=\"linkified\">https://soundcloud.com/das-baumhaus/sets/improvisational-groove-orchestra-baumhaus-23072017</a><br/>• <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/scott-bolden/ebb-and-flow-p2-edit-2\" class=\"linkified\">https://soundcloud.com/scott-bolden/ebb-and-flow-p2-edit-2</a><br/>• <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/scott\" class=\"linkified\">https://soundcloud.com/scott</a>-</p> <p>• Here is a video showing another fun method with larger groups: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjzmfpnZhDk\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjzmfpnZhDk</a></p> <p>The address is Gerichtstr. 23 in the front house on the ground floor, you can walk in our door from the sidewalk.

Nach dem Abendessen tauchen wir in einen weiteren **I. G. O. eine aktive meditative Jam Session....</p> <p>Wir freuen uns darauf, mit verschiedenen Gruppen und Einzelpersonen zusammenzutreffen, um zu sehen, welche Zusammenarbeit wir gemeinsam entwickeln können.</p> <p>Pay-as-you-feel €3 - €8:: Wir bitten unsere Gäste zu berücksichtigen:<br/>• ihr persönliches Budget<br/>• der Wert ihrer Erfahrungen im Baumhaus<br/>• den Wert der Unterstützung des Baumhauses, damit wir diese und viele andere Erfahrungen weiter vermitteln können</p> <p>Programm:</p> <p>16:00 - 19:30 Freiwillige Helferin beim Kochen</p> <p>17:00 - Türen öffnen - Chill and open networking in der \"Open Greeting Zone\"</p> <p>19:30 - Alles, was Sie essen können, gerettetes Buffet (je nach Lust und Laune bezahlen) + auftauchendes Networking und Ausgehen.

Unser Ziel ist es, uns auf das gemeinsame Gefühl einzustellen, das wir im gegenwärtigen Moment entwickeln.</p> <p>Das meiste von dem, was wir tun, ist mit geschlossenen Augen. Dadurch kann jeder Mensch ohne weitere Ablenkung auf den Klangraum fokussiert werden.</p> <p>Bei jeder Session haben wir in der Regel mehr Anfänger als erfahrene Sänger; alle Level und Stimmtypen sind willkommen. Scott wird ein paar grundlegende und intuitiv verständliche Konzepte erklären, die es super einfach machen, in den ersten 15 Minuten einzutauchen und herauszufahren!</p> <p>Es ist ein Lernprozess im Gange, bei dem wir uns jedes Mal in Lautstärke und Ausdruck ausbalancieren, um in den Gruppenklangraum einzugliedern, so dass jeder hören und gehört werden kann und natürlich unsere eigenen Musikstile entwickelt werden.</p> <p>Die letzten Male haben wir uns weiter in das menschliche Sequenzerspiel eingearbeitet - ein System, in dem eine Person als Dirigent agiert und die Gruppe in kleine Teile zerlegt, die jeder kleinen Gruppe einzigartige Impulse geben, die sich dann zu einer Komposition entwickeln.</p> <p>Fühlen Sie sich herzlich willkommen! (bitte pünktlich sein, es gibt wichtige Dinge zu erklären, bevor Sie beginnen)</p> <p>\"Pay as you feel\", 2 - 5€ nach der Sitzung</p> <p>Ältere Tracks aus der vorangegangenen IGO-Session in Das Baumhaus finden Sie hier:- <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/scott-bolden/ebb-and-flow-p2-edit-2\" class=\"linkified\">https://soundcloud.com/scott-bolden/ebb-and-flow-p2-edit-2</a>- <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/scott-bolden/sets/ego-session-5-nov-13-2014\" class=\"linkified\">https://soundcloud.com/scott-bolden/sets/ego-session-5-nov-13-2014</a> (Track 3)</p> <p>Hier ist ein Video, das eine weitere unterhaltsame Methode mit größeren Gruppen zeigt: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjzmfppnZhDk\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjzmfppnZhDk</a></p> <p>Die Adresse lautet Gerichtstr. 23 im Vorderhaus im Erdgeschoss, können Sie in unserer Tür vom Bürgersteig aus gehen.

            "description": "<p>The SF Bay Area Living Future Collaborative will bring together a panel of experts to share how they approach the sustainability value proposition, and how design teams can build a more effective argument for sustainability measures.</p> <p>Sustainability is often seen as something that provides larger value to people and planet, but many owners and developers find that sustainable, deep green design and building also provides real returns on a project basis. This changes the narrative around sustainability from focusing on cost, to focusing on value proposition-whether the approach is in terms of property value, net present value, or capitalization rates. Cost is one of the primary drivers in the decision-making and design process for any construction project. In many cases, cost is seen as a significant barrier to implementing sustainable design. However, many organizations are instead seeing sustainable design as a business opportunity resulting in an improved ROI, an opportunity for social responsibility, and an integral part of their mission-driven models.</p> <p>Thursday 12 July 2018, 5:30 to 7:30 PM<br/>DPR Construction<br/>945 Front Street<br/>San Francisco, CA 94111</p> <p>Price: $10.

The Climate Action Green Room is the place for you!</p> <p>In March 2018, we started this bi-weekly conference call by asking the questions, What is climate change in 2018, and what are you doing about it?</p> <p>This week, we continue our focus on Air Mining and carbontech.</p> <p>Just in the last six months, since your organizers Impossible Labs launched airminers.org, we've seen Manylabs chart a course towards carbontech, the Center for Carbon Removal launched its Carbontech Labs, and the US federal tax code received a carbon capture deduction, called \"45Q.\" All this - and we've barely scratched the surface of what's going on in the space.</p> <p>Thanksgiving is in 5 months and now's the perfect time to practice your Why Climate Change is an Opportunity pitch for your family. Come jam on Air Mining with us and perhaps a symphony will emerge.</p> <p>Looking forward to hearing you.</p> <p>About the Climate Action Green Room:</p> <p>It is intended to be a fire-starter. A spark! A seed! By \"seeing\" and hearing each other, our actions can be more coordinated, more informed, no matter where you are in the climate continuum.</p> <p>In the spirit of local solutions, this is a virtual meeting that takes place on our conference line. The phone number is[masked]. It's also in the notes document (bit.ly/climatenotes), and will be shared in the comments Day-of. For those who have attended previous meetings, it's always the same number.</p> <p>Want to share updates from your project in a safe space? Ask stupid questions? Learn about different opportunities to capitalize on the climate opportunity? This is your chance!</p>",

Il en va de même pour vos consommateurs ou clients ! Toute personne a besoin d'avis extérieurs avant d'acheter un produit ou un service dont il n'a jamais fait l'expérience, vu ou touché. Et face aux discours de promotion de l'entreprise, ils véhiculent la vérité du consommateur (encore faut-il qu'ils soient parfaitement honnêtes !).</p> <p>Le bouche-à-oreille est certainement la plus vieille pratique marketing au monde, seul véhicule de notoriété avant l'apparition des supports publicitaires. Avec le web, le bouche-à-oreille a simplement changé de forme, ou plutôt est devenu multiforme, naviguant entre le \"hors ligne\" et le \"en ligne\". Il devient alors plus puissant avec un taux de conversion important pour un coût d'acquisition par client moindre.</p> <p>Le prochain atelier de Les Talents M sera animé par Nathalie Esain, consultante en expérience client. Son intervention vous permettra de comprendre comment se construit le parcours de la satisfaction client inhérente au bouche-au-oreille, les différentes formes du bouche-à-oreille (en ligne, hors ligne, positif, négatif...), les actions possibles, et ses effets sur l'entreprise, vos collaborateurs, vos ventes et l'engagement client.<br/>Durant l'atelier, vous aurez également l'occasion d'évaluer en direct la performance de vos points de contact.</p> <p>--</p> <p>Des photos seront prises durant l'événement.

Want to find a space to explore, share and learn about all different aspects of this weird thing 'permaculture'?</p> <p>The Permaculture Community Classroom is the answer to all of these! All you need is to come with an idea, a resource or a topic of discussion which you would like to share. If you don't have one, just come with an open mind and willingness to learn.</p> <p>Whatever comes up is what we will talk about and whoever is there are the right people. It also depends a lot on what came up in the previous session.</p> <p>These sessions are intended for discussion and learning, so debate and (friendly!) disagreement are encouraged. Some prior knowledge/experience of permaculture is great in order to delve deeper into the topics we come across, but all levels from ignorant to expert will be warmly welcomed.</p> <p>------------------------</p> <p>Why join us? Well, so far at The Permaculture Community Classroom we have collected a library of over 30 permaculture-relevant books and half a dozen DVDs, two full harddrives (2TBs!!!) of permaculture-relevant films, documents and pdf books and lots of enthusiastic, practical and smiley folk! And the resources just keep growing and growing, free for all to use of course.</p> <p>This event is free to attend however we pay a small fee to rent the space we use and we are always keen to add to our library so donations are gratefully accepted but not required.</p>",

            "description": "<p>This month we'll hear from Mary Ann Everett, a Bell County Master Gardener since 1999, and Central Texas Master Naturalist since 2002. Mary Ann will talk about native gardening for the Central Texas region. Native gardening is the use of plants indigenous to the geographic region which the gardening is taking place. Specifically, she will discuss the plants that add a Pop of Color to your garden and attract hummingbirds and butterflies.</p> <p>Our monthly Science &amp; Sangria meetings will feature speakers who talk about a scientific or environmental topic, followed by a relaxed, informal discussion. The goal is to enable a greater understanding of different topics through exposure to a variety of viewpoints. You don't need to work in science to attend, just have an appreciation for it and be curious.</p>",

In recognition of New York Invasive Species Awareness Week (July 8 – 14, 2018), this walk will feature summer plant identification of a variety of invasive species found at this nature preserve. Please RSVP for this walk by calling Jennifer Viggiani, Town of Clifton Park Open Space Coordinator at (518)[masked]. • What to bring The route that we will walk has a variable trail surface; most of the route is comprised of a flat crushed stone surface for an easy hike, but the middle portion is an uneven dirt path through the woods. However, the entire route is virtually flat. Please bring along your favorite wildflower field guide; I'll be carrying a copy of Newcomb's. Prior to our walk, please peruse the wildflower field guide I have compiled for this preserve: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3gSBBdP\" class=\"linkified\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3gSBBdP</a></p>",

            "description": "<p>Did you know you can become an Angel Investor in startups, investing amongst top angels and venture capitalist for as low as $100?</p> <p>Join us at our monthly meetup to learn how you can start diversifiying your portfolio into startups, real estate, pre-IPO companies, and security tokens! Trying to raise for your own startup? We can help there too!</p> <p>Every month we'll have presentations, panels, and live pitches from companies you can invest in ON THE SPOT from your phone.</p> <p>Schedule:<br/>6:00-7:00 Arrive/Sign-in/Networking<br/>7:00-7:20 Pitches/Panel<br/>7:20-7:30 Quick Break<br/>7:30-8:00 Final Presenter</p> <p>🔥 What are Angel Investors?<br/>They are a special breed of investor that take the risk of investing in startups, early-stage businesses, and entrepreneurs they believe in.</p> <p>💰 What are the average Angel Investor returns?<br/>Investopedia reports angel investment portfolios average between 20-30%* as well as the Angel Capital Association reported their angel investors internal rate of return (IRR) over time was 27%*.</p> <p>🧐 So what about the companies we work with?<br/>One of our partners, Wefunder, just released it's 5-year returns report and since 2013 investors on its platform have earned annual unrealized returns of 53%.</p> <p>In other words, if you’d invested in the deals featured on WeFunder, you could have pocketed gains of 53% each year.</p> <p>Not only is that enough to double your money every 18 months or so, but it’s enough to outperform the very best Venture Capitalists in Silicon Valley…</p> <p>You see, according to research firm Cambridge Associates, over the same five-year investment period, the top U.S. Venture Capitalists earned just 15% per year.</p> <p>In other words, investors like you could have beaten the professionals by about 300%.</p> <p>🤯 Wow... that's a lot! How do they do it?<br/>The key to angel investing is diversification and with Newchip you can find investments starting as low as $100, allowing you to affordably build a large and diverse portfolio of your own.</p> <p>Before recent regulatory changes, you used to have to invest thousands of dollars or more to be able to invest in early-stage companies but now you have the ability to invest as low as $100 apiece into companies.</p> <p>🧐 How much \"should I invest\"?<br/>Angels that reported 27% IRR invested at least 10% of their wealth into angel investing.</p> <p>1. We can't recommend how much you invest but it should only be a % of your total investment portfolio to help manage risk in addition to other investments like- public stocks, real estate, REIT's, etc.</p> <p>2. It should not be your only investment or your entire portfolio. If you invest $1,000 into one company you find on Newchip, and that's it, you are NOT diversifying. That's the exact opposite of diversification.</p> <p>🤓 Why do we care so much about entrepreneurs and startups?<br/>Entrepreneurship is the #1 driver for social impact globally, and at Newchip we’re on a mission to change the world through it. It's that simple.</p> <p>🤷 So who are we?<br/>We're a group of entrepreneurs that believe there should be better investment options than what the financial advisors that led us into the Great Recession recommend to us.</p> <p>For the first time, we can all affordably invest alongside professional investors in startups, pre-IPO companies, real estate, REIT’s, and even blockchain technologies and security tokens.</p> <p>This new type investing is revolutionizing how companies grow, scale, and create products. It's helping entrepreneurs connect to investors they never would have had access to and helping investors to invest in what they believe in.</p> <p>💡 I've never heard of this. What do I call it?<br/>It goes by many names: crowd investing, investment crowdfunding and equity crowdfunding. It was born from Kickstarter and Indiegogo, but instead of getting a t-shirt and thank you, you can now receive and own a slice of the companies.</p>",

            "description": "<p>What is wrong with American education? In our July meeting we will consider thought provoking ideas put forward by educationalist Sir Ken Robinson. The meeting will begin with a 19-minute video in which Professor Robinson outlines 3 principles crucial for the human mind to flourish – and how current education culture works against them. In a funny, stirring talk he tells us how to get out of the educational \"death valley\" we now face, and how to nurture our youngest generations with a climate of possibility. Sir Kenneth Robinson is a British author, speaker and international advisor on education in the arts to government, non-profits, education and arts bodies. He was Professor of Arts Education at the University of Warwick. In 2003 he was knighted for services to the arts. He currently resides in the U.S. The video will be followed by a discussion and sharing of wisdom which hopefully will enrich us all. Ron Rubin will lead the group. Your ideas and participation are welcome. As usual, we will meet from 6 to 9 PM upstairs at the Moonstruck Restaurant located at 449 Third Avenue at the Southeast corner of East 31st Street, New York. Please being friends and family; have dinner at 6, if you can, but all are welcome anytime. We will start the video at 7:00 PM to allow time for discussion after. Note that because this meeting is being held in a restaurant, food and adult beverage of your choice will be available for purchase. Smar10up think tank NYC will be co-hosting this meetup with the Metropolitan Humanists of New York City and several other groups.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Because people are busy with summer plans, and I am getting this post up a week late, our next book will be a brief one: a genre-blending (part graphic novel) work by Mark Kurlansky, author of the best-selling non-fiction titles, Cod and Salt.</p> <p>KIRKUS REVIEW<br/>The author of Cod (1997) successfully provides readers with a frightening look at the looming destruction of the oceans. Brief sections in graphic-novel format follow a young girl, Ailat, and her father over a couple of decades as the condition of the ocean grows increasingly dire, eventually an orange, slimy mess mostly occupied by jellyfish and leatherback turtles. At the end, Ailat’s young daughter doesn’t even know what the word fish means. This is juxtaposed against nonfiction chapters with topics including types of fishing equipment and the damage each causes, a history of the destruction of the cod and its consequences, the international politics of the fishing industry and the effects of pollution and global warming. The final chapter lists of some actions readers could take to attempt to reverse the damage: not eating certain types of fish, joining environmental groups, writing to government officials, picketing seafood stores that sell endangered fish, etc. Whenever an important point is to be made, font size increases dramatically, sometimes so that a single sentence fills a page—attention-getting but distractingly so. While it abounds with information, sadly, no sources are cited, undermining reliability. Additionally, there are no index and no recommended bibliography for further research, diminishing this effort’s value as a resource. Depressing and scary yet grimly entertaining.

If you haven’t finished the book by the time we meet, you are still warmly invited. All view points and people of all ages are welcome in our civil discussions.</p> <p>Summary from Good Reads:<br/>Michael Alexander Allen, the baby cousin of an extended family, was first arrested at fifteen for an attempted carjacking. Tried as an adult and sentenced to thirteen years, Michael served eleven. Three years after his release, he was shot and killed. Why? Why did this gifted young man, who dreamed of being a firefighter and a writer, end up dead? Why did he languish in prison? And why at fifteen was he in an alley in South Central LA, holding a gun while trying to steal someone’s car? Cuz means both “cousin” and “because.”</p> <p>Terry Gross’ interview with the author Danielle Allen <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2017/09/20/552318248/cuz-examines-the-tragic-life-and-death-of-a-young-black-man-in-la\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.npr.org/2017/09/20/552318248/cuz-examines-the-tragic-life-and-death-of-a-young-black-man-in-la</a></p> <p>New York Times article<br/><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/books/review-cuz-danielle-allen.html\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/books/review-cuz-danielle-allen.html</a></p> <p>————————————————<br/>• What we'll do<br/>We are the Young Professionals for CARE in Philadelphia.

            "description": "<p>This is a meeting for music show hosts and those who want to DJ on Radio. Meeting locations change, so email [masked].</p> <p>How much local music do you hear on the San Diego airwaves?<br/>Corporate radio would have you believe that we live in a local music desert!</p> <p>The truth is that San Diego has a vibrant community of local musicians and artists, but commercial radio has all but ignored local talent. Not surprising because many San Diego stations are programmed out of corporate headquarters with the same playlist as doled out in Idaho and Maine. Shame on them!</p> <p>KNSJ 89.1 FM intends to revolutionize the airwaves. KNSJ is community radio and wants to change the cultural landscape with alternative programming while supporting local artists and their listeners. KNSJ pledges to play more local bands and artists than all the rest of San Diego's radio stations combined.</p> <p>KNSJ intends to focus on creative and socially conscious music. John Legend, in accepting the Oscar for best song, reminded us that \"it's an artist’s duty to reflect the times we're in,\"... \" the struggle for justice is right now.\" KNSJ wants to create a cultural revolution of hope, of optimism, of love and ire... inspiring collective action to save the planet. While some music is created as escapism, other music becomes anthems for consciousness and change.</p> <p>KNSJ’s Local Music Summits bring together local DJs, music producers, musicians and show hosts to talk about transforming the airwaves with new local radio shows and podcasts. KNSJ’s current local shows include Sonic Sundowner with Benjamin Cossel and Train of Thought Podcast with Gill Sotu. The expectation is that the Local Music Summits will spawn a dozen other music shows from hip-hop to folk, reggae to Blues, Latin, Asian, African and Worldbeat. Many of these programs will feature interviews and insights into the musicians and their creative process as they minister through their music. The expectation is that more local music on the air will result in a growing appreciation of local cultural treasures and in time will result in larger audiences allowing for more musicians being able to sustain themselves through their craft. KNSJ looks towards the day when it becomes a clearing house for local music. KNSJ expects to host live music on the air, and co-sponsor concerts and festivals where there is a convergence of many of the performing arts including spoken word and dance. These music events will in turn support the community radio station, which depends on individual donations for its future growth.</p> <p>Local musicians wanting to get their talent on the air can post their music on KNSJ at <a href=\"http://knsj.org/music/\" class=\"linkified\">http://knsj.org/music/</a></p> <p>Listen Up: No matter where you are you can listen to KNSJ.org or use the TuneIn radio app or find us on iTunes.</p> <p>For more information contact: [masked] or call[masked].</p>",

Parking is free on that road. You must park within 12 inches of the curb. (Please note that Fred Fletcher Park has several entrances. Read the parking signs CAREFULLY so that your car is not ticketed.)<br/>I drive a 2013 Gray Nissan Rogue. Back plate 0PTMYSTC, front plate says \"His Eye Is On The Sparrow\".<br/>Fred Fletcher Park is a good beginner's birdwalk: paved walkways and a short walk with several habitats, and birds that tend to be used to humans. But it MIGHT not be worth driving a long way for this park, unless you are going to head to the downtown museums or drive over to Mid Pines and Yates Mill afterwards (I have a commitment at 9:30).<br/>Fred Fletcher Park has a VERY SMALL marsh and thicket, plus some mowed fields with trees and shrubs. Fred Fletcher Park might give us a surprising number of birds for an urban park.</p> <p>Checklist for July walk in 2017:<br/><a href=\"https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S38130464\" class=\"linkified\">https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S38130464</a></p> <p>Leader: Erla Beegle; [masked] or text/call her at[masked]<br/>NOTE: There is only a portapotty at this park -- please plan accordingly (Starbucks and MacDonalds nearby on Peace just west of Glenwood, but you have to drive there, so allow extra time.)</p>",

Volunteer pizzaioli will prepare delectable toppings, including fresh vegetables and meats, roll the original-recipe pizza dough, and help make the mouth-watering pizza pies. This program, spearheaded and developed by ASU professor, Dr. Phil Mizzi, and influenced by one of the top Italian pizzaioli in the United States, producing an average of 120 gourmet pizzas each Friday, was designed as a healthy and economical solution to enhance the quality of meals and promote the dignity of guests through the quality of service and the care and compassion of volunteers. The pizzas are all made in the kitchen at St. Vincent de Paul's Main Campus, then distributed alternately each Friday between two of SVdP's Phoenix dining rooms (including the on-site Family Dining Room). The only thing missing from the extensive menu of Salami, Creamy Roasted Red Pepper Sauce, Asparagus, Shiitaki Mushrooms, Salami, Arugula, Cherry Tomatoes, Basil, Corn, Pancetta, Roasted Garlic, Blue Cheese, and so much more, is you! So grab your spice rack of love, energy, good fun, and cheer, and join us in the cucina!

Right before we were set to start, Veritas contacted Supervisor Peskin's office and said that if he did not attend the event, then Veritas would sit down and negotiate all pending O&amp;M passthroughs across the city. I spoke with Sup. Peskin's office about this decision, and Sup. Peskin decided to not attend to keep that option on the table while ensuring the press conference would still continue.</p> <p>That was a VICTORY for us, as it gave us new leverage to negotiate pending passthroughs for buildings that won't benefit from the legislation!</p> <p>Then, the Veritas lobbyist called Supervisor Fewer and begged us to call off the march to Greentree's office. Because of organizing this action, we suddenly gained leverage. I brought the issue to the tenants who were there, and tenants voted to continue with the press conference and march.</p> <p>As a result of this action, we got leverage to negotiate other buildings' pending passthroughs AND we saw what weakens Veritas: organized tenants, public action, and media exposure!</p> <p>For the legislation, it was introduced that day, April 3. We are now in a 30-day waiting period before it goes to committee for a public hearing. During this time, we need to talk with our supervisors. I'm going to send a separate email tomorrow with more info on this strategy and how to get involved, but for now, if you don't know your supervisor, please click HERE to type in your address and find your district number and supervisor.

            "description": "<p>Give the gift of a warm meal and become inspired by serving it to the great men reestablishing their lives at the Allentown Rescue Mission. You will be very glad you did afterwards. We have been doing this activity over a year and it has been a great event for everyone who has volunteered from Lehigh Valley People Helping People. Come back or join us for the first time. We welcome all with open arms and hearts!</p> <p>Requirements:</p> <p>:-) Bring a food item(s) from the list below.</p> <p>:-) Show up at the Allentown Rescue Mission from 4-6 pm and join in socializing with our group members and serving our meal to the men at the mission.</p> <p>* We are hoping to have 8 members make and serve food on July 13th and an additional 3 or 4 members who will make food and drop off at the Mission prior to our dinner.<br/>*Please email Mike H. what you will bring. The more food the better, nothing goes to waste.</p> <p>Food Items Needed:</p> <p>8 large trays of baked ziti (easy to make...ground beef/pork/turkey, 2 boxes of ziti noodles, tomato sauce, cheese, etc.).</p> <p>45 slices/pieces of garlic bread</p> <p>45 deserts (cupcakes, brownies, donut, Tasty Cake type snacks, etc.)</p> <p>Here is the scoop:</p> <p>Arrive at 4 pm at the Allentown Rescue Mission with your food for dinner. Your food items should only need to be reheated at the Mission. Completely bake/cook before bringing the food item.</p> <p>If anyone wants to bring any table decorations for the cafeteria, notes of encouragement, or play an instrument or sing while the men are dining, this is very welcome by the ARM staff. You are welcome to join the men for dinner. Each has his own story of life's journey into homelessness then rehabilitation through the Mission. However, this is all optional, most of us just come with a meal and serve.</p> <p>4 pm - 5 pm Our MeetUp group assembles in a room the ARM provides us and we enjoy talking and socializing with each other, helping out the ARM kitchen staff to set up the meal, etc.</p> <p>5 pm - 6 pm Serving time...we take turns behind a cafeteria serving line. As residents filter through the line in a very organized manner, we fill plates with food and put them on top of the station for the men to put on their tray as they head to their dining room with ARM staff to enjoy dinner. Residents are very appreciative and well organized by the ARM staff.</p> <p>6 pm Driving home with a great feeling and a smile on our collective faces and in our hearts!</p> <p>If you cannot attend and are willing to make food to drop off at the ARM on July 13th, that is also appreciated. Just message me (Mike H.) and let me know what you will drop off for our dinner. When you drop off your food donation, just mention it is for dinner with Lehigh Valley People Helping People.</p> <p>Please no open toe shoes. Hair nets and aprons are provided by ARM staff.</p> <p>This is a really great event...hope you can make it...everyone who has done this MeetUp has really seemed to enjoy the experience. Sign up, come out, you will be glad you did! :)</p>",

Never before have we saved time with more sophisticated technologies. But nearly everyone feels they don’t have enough time.</p> <p>Florian Opitz tries to track down the reasons for our lack of time and the constant acceleration of our lives. He reveals a disturbing picture of a civilisation that has disposed of all brake systems and goes blindly for unlimited and eternal growth - no matter what the consequences. But Opitz also tries to find the good life. In the niches of the global capitalism he discovers alternatives to the rat race.</p> <p>SCHEDULE:<br/>18.00 TransitieCinema Dinner by Juni Café in Het Nutshuis<br/>19.30 Screening \"Speed - in search of lost time\" by TransitieCinema<br/>21.00 Workshop, drinks and informal discussion!</p> <p>NOTE:<br/>* Admission to the MOVIE is for FREE (but we appreciate donations!)<br/>* Make sure to ARRIVE ON TIME, the doors are closed when the movie starts or the venue is at full capacity.<br/>* The DINNER is vegan and can be reserved online at nutshuis.nl (you can also join without a reservation)<br/>* The movie and event are in ENGLISH (but we try to accommodate for Dutch too)</p>",

All funds generated will go toward the work of the coalition to ban new oil drilling and ban all fracking. Tickets are between $10-$20, see ticket link for details and to RSVP for limited available seating. Food will be available for purchase!</p> <p>ABOUT THE FILM: If a crime is committed in order to prevent a greater crime, is it forgivable? Is it, in fact, necessary? THE RELUCTANT RADICAL is an intimate portrait of climate activist Ken Ward. Ken breaks the law as a last resort and with great trepidation, to fulfill what he sees as his personal obligation to future generations. The film follows Ken through a series of civil disobedience direct actions, culminating with his participation in the coordinated action that shut down all the U.S. tar sands oil pipelines on October 11, 2016. Facing 20 years in prison for his actions, the film reveals both the personal costs and also the fulfillment that comes from following one’s moral calling.</p> <p>“There are many fronts in the vast climate fight; this film highlights the personal struggles and victories of one daring path.” -Bill McKibben, Climate Advocate and Founder of 350.org</p> <p>“He was told he was crazy, but crazy is sitting idly by as disaster for young people is knowingly locked in.” -Dr. James Hansen, Climate Scientist</p> <p>Coalition to Protect SLO County<br/>Paid for by CoProSLOCo FPPC #[masked]</p>",

A one and a half hour presentation by a member of the School of Permaculture team will be given followed by a suburban permaculture food forest garden tour. A very positive and open discussion about anything related is encouraged and usually follows (we promote networking!). Once completed you can obtain an Introduction into Permaculture certificate that states you have completed an Introduction into Permaculture class and can be used for continuing education as well.

            "description": "<p>Are you struggling with stress and anxiety? You are not alone. With our political scene, relationships, money, career and all the other situations that come with life it’s good if we have all the tools we can gather to support us through trying times. EFT is one of those powerful tools. EFT stands for Emotional Freedom Techniques. Also know as tapping. We are energy in a fleshly package and good energy flow is necessary for our well being. Everything that happens to us in life is energy. That energy can be positive or negative. The good energy flows through our system smoothly and doesn’t get stalled. If the energy is negative or low it can get stuck in our bodies and cause emotional issues or even physical manifestations. That is where EFT comes in. While being tuned in to a negative emotion and tapping on certain points on the body a signal is sent through the energy system and essentially cleans it out. That signal also goes to the fight or flight center in the brain and shuts it down or calms it. You in turn get relief.</p> <p>Come and see how it works at my workshop at: $15 Cash at 🚪 door</p> <p>Center for Inner Wisdom<br/>4849 N Dixie Hwy<br/>Oakland Park, FL 33334<br/>7-8:30PM 7/13/18<br/>My phone is[masked] and the Center phone is[masked]</p>",

This FREE lecture and group discussion held by the School of Permaculture is a great opportunity to learn, network, and gain an introduction certificate to Permaculture. A one and a half hour presentation by a member of the School of Permaculture team will be given followed by a suburban permaculture food forest garden tour. A very positive and open discussion about anything related is encouraged and usually follows (we promote networking!). Once completed you can obtain an Introduction into Permaculture certificate that states you have completed an Introduction into Permaculture class and can be used for continuing education as well. The location is at a Plano, TX residence with a backyard full of permaculture goodies including: rain water harvesting, gray water bed filtration and use, suburban food forestry, serious composting, strategic permaculture gardening and more.</p> <p>For any questions contact us via e-mail at [masked]</p>",

            "description": "<p>Demitasse performing at Confluence is the first of a series of “Concerts at the Confluence” presented by the San Antonio River Foundation.</p> <p>FREE CONCERT at SUNSET! Lucky Friday the 13th.</p> <p>So much is happening in Demitassse world. As many of you know, Demitasse, is the smallest of bands, just myself and Joe Reyes. We typically play as a duo, with a starkly minimal setup. Two acoustic guitars and our two voices.</p> <p>But on Friday the 13th of July we promise a different set up. For nearly the first time ever, Demitasse will play as a full band. Accompanied by Odie (Buttercup) on bass, we will march nearly into rock territory. This band, what I'm calling the Demitasse Good Times Band, is devastatingly capable. With Chris Maddin, former Glassnote recording artist, on piano and backing vocals, the songs will have a piano-drenched mellowness that will make you smile. Dane Rousay joins on drums, and his soft style is perfectly suited for Demitasse. And of course, Odie brings it full circle and grounds us. It's a fantastic band full of crack musicians: I couldn't be more excited.</p> <p>We will begin our performance at sunset. It is free. All ages are welcome. There is limited parking on site, so you may want to park on the street, or walk or cycle to the park. Come and bring some folding chairs or a blanket and non-alcoholic drinks. We preview our new album.</p>",

Spreading awareness<br/>4. Making saplings of aquatic plants</p> <p>What you should bring: - We discourage the culture of use and throw. So, bringing a bottle of water from home is advised. - Bring loads of enthusiasm. - Also bring at least one new volunteer! :)</p> <p>NEAREST METRO STATION: Rajendra Place</p> <p>GOOGLE MAPS LOCATION: <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps?q=28.6458967,77.1786167&amp;z=17&amp;hl=en\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.google.com/maps?q=28.6458967,77.1786167&amp;z=17&amp;hl=en</a> ---</p> <p>ABOUT THIS PROJECT: Delhi has 100s of water bodies! Or we should say had. Because most of them are nearly dead. They are dumped with garbage and religious offerings and their surface has algae. These factors lead to low levels of dissolved oxygen, making marine life unsustainable. Moreover, it leads to other problems like breeding of mosquitoes. One such victim is Prasad Nagar Lake. Yes, the same place we had our nature walk. Guess what's our new project? Revival of Prasad Nagar Lake. Yes, this is a long term project and we have government support too! As a part of this whole project we will clear all plastic and other waste lying at the bottom of this lake. And we will later introduce water plants such a lotus and water lilies in it. Introduction of aquatic plants is vital for the lake's health. It'll ensure optimum dissolved oxygen levels for other aquatic life such as a variety of fish. It'll also help keep the lake naturally clean and prevent any mosquito breeding. So, let's join hands to do something big, something very interesting!</p>",

Street and on-site parking is available. It's best to park on the street and not in their parking lot because it's easier to leave at the end. I usually have no problem finding street parking. You may have to walk a little.

Works volunteers -- to sort, stack and shelve valuable food to distribute to the hungry throughout Los Angeles. Make someone's day, or dinner!</p> <p>Registration is from 8:30 am to 9:00 am – volunteer project starts at 9:00 am to 12:00 pm. Please bring a signed release form on your day of service.</p> <p>Release form: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E75lQlubyyeG07mEFpHGjSZukqI1liCt/view?usp=sharing\" class=\"linkified\">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E75lQlubyyeG07mEFpHGjSZukqI1liCt/view?usp=sharing</a> Minimum age requirement to volunteer is 14 years old, sorry no exceptions. All volunteers that are UNDER 18 years old are required to bring proof of age with picture ID (school ID, state ID, passport, or birth certificate). There is also a Image Release Form that I will send in the email before. L.A. Regional FoodBank provides food support to numerous community agencies serving Los Angeles, ranging from large homeless shelters that feed hundreds of people a day to small daycare programs. It is the second largest foodbank operating in the United States.</p> <p>Accessibility: L.A. Works firmly believes that we strengthen the social fabric of our community by involving all in service. If you feel you need accommodations to participate in this project please let me know</p> <p>Dress Code: Safety requirements include: no open-toe/open-heel shoes or high heels. We recommend casual attire (jeans, t-shirt, light sweater, &amp; tennis shoes) Note: Be sure to bring something warm, because one time we sorted food in a much cooler part of the warehouse. We don't know where they will ask us to help!</p>",

<p>____________________________________________</p> <p>Throughout Southern California, food is given for free to people who might be struggling (e.g. unemployed, disabled, homeless, low-income families, seniors on fixed incomes, etc.).</p> <p>Individuals, food banks, markets/grocery stores, food manufacturers, restaurants, farmers, and others donate food to partner agencies such as soup kitchens, food pantries, churches, and other charities &amp; non-profits for reaching people in need of food.</p> <p>Caveat:  Some distributions occur at churches.  I could be wrong, but my conjecture is most food distributions don't involve proselytizing.  If anyone is atheist, agnostic, anti-religion, non-religious, Jewish, Muslim, or of a different faith...please know I always ask the respective church group before posting if they allow anyone to participate. </p> <p>If you see this event here, then it should mean they are receptive of everyone outside their church group who wants to help (age requirements of kids/minors might apply for some).</p> <p>Also, if this location (or date/time) is not convenient for you, scroll to the bottom of this description for info on how to find other food distributions.</p> <p>____________________________________________</p> <p>All food distributions differ.  Each group might do things differently and have unique rules/restrictions. </p> <p>In general, examples of tasks include setting up tables, unloading/unboxing the food donations, neatly organizing and placing food donations on tables, helping with passing out food, assisting with the clients in line, registration/check-in, and clean-up.</p> <p>Some food distributions are outdoors...while some might be indoors.</p> <p>Some people might prefer to avoid events related to the homeless or anything involve cooking or getting dirty...so in general, food distributions are another option of volunteer events to choose from.</p> <p>Plus, this can be a great way to meet people (the other volunteers) who live near you compared to other meetup events that are far and you might not see the other volunteers again.  Many people who volunteer are friendly, so this can be an effective way to meet people and make new friends in your area.</p> <p>____________________________________________</p> <p>These photos are from other food distributions.  Not all are identical, so the following pics might give a general idea of what some distributions look like.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.784465194996859\">www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a[masked]</a></p> <p><a

<p>____________________________________________</p> <p>Okay...finally, here are the details for this specific food distribution.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4HpRuAwZ0s\" class=\"embedded\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4HpRuAwZ0s</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.lakewoodfirstumc.org/broken-loaf-food-pantry\">www.lakewoodfirstumc.org/broken-loaf-food-pantry</a></p> <p>\"Volunteers can help by assisting clients with their shopping, help in the clothing room, and support serving of refreshments in the refreshment area.\"</p> <p>The church address is on Bellflower Blvd.  Parking might be available in their parking lot.  If parking on a street, such as Harvey Way, look for a driveway entrance/exit or alley such as</p> <p><img src=\"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/9/d/5/highres_464143477.jpeg\" /></p> <p>Look for a metal door that should be open.  It should be near their kitchen or pantry.  If you see other people, ask for the \"Captain\" (probably the person in charge) and he/she will help you get started on how to help.</p> <p><b>Important:</b>  This is automatically posted in this group.  I will try to check the schedule for conflicts with holidays, but in case I forget, please feel free to contact the church to confirm a food pantry event is happening this Saturday.  They are open nearly every Saturday except major holidays.  The church contact info can be found at the bottom of <a href=\"http://www.lakewoodfirstumc.org/broken-loaf-food-pantry\">www.lakewoodfirstumc.org/broken-loaf-food-pantry</a></p> <p>btw, sometimes events like this are unpredictable...maybe one week they are low on volunteers and another week/month they have a bunch of unexpected volunteers show up (students, another group/company, etc.).  So if they are crowded and have \"too many\" volunteers, thank you for your patience and understanding with whatever happens.</p> <p>____________________________________________</p> <p>If this location is not geographically convenient for you or your schedule.  Other cities throughout SoCal have food distributions that might need volunteers.  Some food distributions occur on weekday mornings.  A few occur on weekday afternoons or evenings.  While some occur on weekends.  So there's a chance you can find one that is near you and fits your availability.</p> <p><b>Orange County</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://feedoc.org/get-help/get-food-2\"><a

Full boxes are then placed on the Maryland Food Bank's daily menu, available for more than 600 soup kitchens, pantries and shelters across the state to order.</p>",

The garden is exclusively devoted to shrubs of the rose family and features over 4,000 rose shrubs with 189 varieties represented.</p> <p>Like many public parks they have limited resources. Please join us on Saturday, July 14th (Community Volunteer Day) to help provide gardening care and basic landscaping for the 3,500 rose bushes. Tasks include, but aren't limited to, deadheading (clipping off spent blooms), weeding, mulching, pruning and planting.</p> <p>Volunteers are encouraged to bring a filled water bottle, wear closed-toe shoes, hat, dress in layers (long sleeves and pants are recommended to protect against rose thorns), and wear sunscreen. Gloves will be provided but you're welcome to bring your own if you have a pair.</p> <p>All tools and training will be provided.</p> <p>If you have any questions, please call/text me (Magesh) at[masked].

An agricultural system where fish and plants are raised symbiotically: fish waste provides nutrients to plants, while plants filter the water for fish. Benefits of aquaponics include year-round growing, near-freedom from the need to weed and treat for pests, and fresh fish! Aquaponics can be done indoors, provided there is sufficient natural or artificial light, or outside seasonally.</p> <p>LOCATION: 19th and Alter Street, Philadelphia, PA</p> <p>2 options for COST:<br/>A) Participate in guided system assembly (materials provided) and take your garden home: $250.<br/>B) Observe workshop and learn about system maintenance: $25.</p> <p>*Enjoy Greenstreet Coffee as you build your system!</p> <p>Email [masked] to reserve a spot or get info about future workshops. He will provide additional details for you to review before confirming your spot. Please title all messages “DIY Aquaponics RSVP”. In the message, please include:<br/>1. If you would like to reserve a spot in this workshop or a future workshop.<br/>2. If you would like to build a system or just observe.</p> <p>Note from the organizer, Robin: I may not be able to attend this event myself, but the workshop is run by my friend Will Cauffman and I thought it was a great fit for this Meetup. All further inquiries can be made directly to Will. Enjoy!</p>",

            "description": "<p>Come out to Minnewaska State Park this Saturday morning and enjoy a day of walking and hiking on carriage roads and trails. Our destination is Rainbow Falls, deep in the woods of the park. We have not had much rain so there may not be much water coming over the falls, but the location is beautiful and the woods are cool.</p> <p>We will begin at the Lower Awosting parking area and walk 2.5 miles on the Lower Awosting Carriageway to get to the Rainbow Falls trail. We will hike this road first as it has little tree cover so we will be cooler hiking it early in the day. We will then descend into the ravine to see the falls. This section of trail is about .6 miles. We will leave the ravine and take the Upper Awosting Carriageway for about .8 miles to the Blueberry Run Trail. After about .3 miles we will connect with the Mossy Glen Trail and follow the Peters Kill stream for about 1.5 miles back to our cars. This trail is very well shaded and peaceful.</p> <p>Difficulty: Easy/moderate<br/>Distance: About 5.7 miles<br/>Time: approximately 4-5 hours</p> <p>Bring at least 2 liters of water, snacks, lunch, an extra layer of clothing, sun screen, bug spray, hat, sun glasses, hiking shoes/boots, personal first aid items and medications.</p> <p>There is a $10 fee per car to enter the park so carpooling encouraged. Contact each other to do so.</p>",

            "description": "<p>Live like a Scout again! For our July Meetup we're combining a helpful, outdoor service project with some fun, fellowship &amp; adventure in the beautiful First State National Historical Park at Beaver Valley - a stone's throw from the PA/DE border. We'll be gathering in the morning to help the park with much-needed trail maintenance &amp; preservation. Then after a tasty &amp; refreshing picnic lunch we'll be offering hiking, biking, fishing, and kayaking to all those looking to add some adventure to their day of service. Come join us, bring the family &amp; make some new friends, support the park, get dirty &amp; have some outdoor fun like only Scouting Alumni know how!</p> <p>The park staff will be directing us &amp; providing any necessary gear to complete our service project. But come prepared (as a Scout should) with your own rugged clothing &amp; footwear, tick/mosquito repellent, rain poncho, work gloves (if you have them), sunscreen &amp; wide-brimmed hat, and plenty of water. We'll be working during the morning only, with the rest of the day to enjoy the park as you wish - or you can go home after the project is complete....your call.</p> <p>And don't worry - we'll have restrooms on site.</p> <p>After the project we'll have a picnic lunch, so feel free to bring coolers with whatever you like - which you can keep in your vehicle until lunchtime. No alcohol permitted, and no grilling will be available. But bring whatever else you'd like to munch on &amp; refresh with.</p> <p>Then the park is yours. 18 miles of trails (hike or bike) in the beautiful Brandywine Valley. Historic Quaker Settlement ruins. And the waters of the Brandywine Creek beckon your fishing rod or kayak. Or you can simply enjoy the great outdoors - it's nature out the wazoo and yours to explore.</p> <p>And come ready to meet your fellow Scouting Alumni Meetup members and make some new friends, too. This will be our first major outing - the first of many - and we'd love to build a fun &amp; vibrant group that's committed to community service, outdoor adventure, and friendship &amp; fellowship. And we can only do it with your participation. We're looking forward to seeing you!</p>",

We have listened and have designed a Permaculture Design Course that harmonizes with these hurdles and makes learning permaculture truly accessible.</p> <p>Our format makes this course very accessible for learning permaculture and in obtaining very valuable hands on permaculture experience, as well as getting your permaculture design certification.</p> <p>SOME OF THE IMMEDIATE PERKS:<br/>Come When You Can</p> <p>This course will integrate into your daily life as it runs twice, continuously throughout the year. We aim for every second weekend of the month but may change which weekends in presence of a major event or holiday. This allows for a “Come When You Can” model where you are never under any pressure to feel rushed or crammed to fit the course into your daily life.</p> <p>The course runs in it’s entirety 2 times a year. One starts in January and the other in July. Take as long as you want to finish the course (years if needed but not recommended) and come any day of the course. If you cannot start on day 1, then a Free Intro Into Permaculture Class (that is given every Friday evening before each weekend of the course) is necessary to start on any other day of the course.</p> <p>Flexible Payment – Pay Course Entirety or Per Weekend</p> <p>No longer will you HAVE to come up with all of the funds to pay for the Permaculture Design Course all at once. This Permaculture Design Course format lifts the burden off of us (on certain levels) which in turn will lift the financial burden off of you. If you have the funds all at once – great pay the course in full and get a considerable discount by doing so. If you would like to pay by the weekend that is great too!</p> <p>Build Relationships</p> <p>Most Permaculture Design Courses run for 2 weeks straight. This is a great submersion experience and we still offer these kinds of courses. However, what they lack is the long term relationships that are made with seeing the same faces and making strong connections with your peers and teachers. Permaculture IS about relationships and this format harnesses that power.</p> <p>Mature Kids Can Come Free</p> <p>We would love to run day care but we just are not staffed to do so. But your child/children ages 12-17 can come for free. Our staff may interview your kid/s too to help in making our Permaculture for Orphans Program the best it can be. You never know they might learn something too.</p> <p>What is Permaculture?<br/>Permaculture, is a design system that works with nature to help provide for all your human needs, and designed to benefit all life on the planet. Once established it creates a time-rich environment where people can go to a place of employment because they want to, not because they have to.</p> <p>A vast array of different disciplines are learned through Permaculture. Since the range of topics are so vast we offer additional workshops and courses for very in-depth specialized education, experience, and training.</p> <p>Topics and disciplines covered in Permaculture:<br/>Making a Change<br/>Architecture<br/>Soil Biology<br/>Regenerative Gardening &amp; Farming<br/>Urban Permaculture<br/>Earthworks<br/>Animal Husbandry<br/>Climatology<br/>Aquaculture<br/>Nutrition and Natural Healing<br/>Community and Anthropology</p> <p>Location &amp; Times<br/>Course Location<br/>Saturdays:<br/>City of Plano Sustainability &amp; Environmental Education (EEC Building)<br/>4200 W.

            "description": "<p>A Permaculture Design Course That Works With You!<br/>Come When You Can | Start When You Can | Pay When You Can</p> <p>Many students express their deep desire to take a Permaculture Design Course but cannot due to limitations such as finances, time, and family obligations. Not the case at School of Permaculture! Our Permaculture Design Course harmonizes with these hurdles and makes learning permaculture truly accessible and allows for obtaining very valuable group-learning, in-person permaculture experience, as well as getting a permaculture design certification upon completion of the course.</p> <p>SOME OF THE IMMEDIATE PERKS:<br/>Come When You Can - This course will integrate into your daily life as it runs twice, continuously throughout the year. We aim for every SECOND weekend of the month but may change which weekends in presence of a major event or holiday. This relieves any pressure to feel rushed or crammed to fit the course into your daily life.</p> <p>Flexible Payment – Pay Course Entirety or Per Weekend<br/>No longer will you HAVE to come up with all of the funds to pay for the Permaculture Design Course all at once. This Permaculture Design Course format lifts the burden off of us (on certain levels) which in turn will lift the financial burden off of you. If you have the funds all at once – great pay the course in full. If you would like to pay by the weekend that is great too! We offer couples discounts and discounts for paying in full!</p> <p>Build Relationships<br/>Most Permaculture Design Courses run for 2 weeks straight. This is a great submersion experience and we will offer these kinds of courses on our farm. However, what they lack is the long term relationships that are made with seeing the same faces and making strong connections with your peers and teachers. Permaculture IS about relationships and this format harnesses that power.</p> <p>Kids Come Free<br/>We would love to run day care but we just are not staffed to do so. But your children ages 12-17 can come for free alongside a parent/relative attending. Kids will not be granted a design certificate without prior arrangements being made with the school.</p> <p>Course Times<br/>Each day starts at 9:00 am and ends at 5:00 pm (Both Saturday/Sunday)</p> <p>Course Location<br/>Saturdays<br/>City of Plano Sustainability &amp; Environmental Education (EEC Building)<br/>4200 W.

This is an opportunity to learn from Peter Block how to take a greater role in bringing the ideas of engagement into your community. Please join us! We will explore: Matching the level of small group engagement with the purpose of gathering. Giving people the protocols to use small groups every place they go, especially people working on community projects. Creating a new normal for meetings. Too many meetings about community keep the speaker in front and citizens lined up in straight rows like sardines. We are calling an end to straight rows.</p> <p>Cost: $35 - includes lunch and your time and commitment. We ask that you bring a snack or beverage to share with the group. This helps to keep costs down.</p> <p>If you are new to the A Small Group conversations, we recommend you attend the next A Small Group monthly gathering or download and read the Civic Engagement booklet here. It will give you a context for what our intentions are for the day and enhance your experience.</p> <p>RSVP by July 12, click here or by contacting Elaine Hansen at [masked].</p> <p>• What to bring</p> <p>• Important to know</p>",

Yesterday, Eastland announced that they will no longer pursue plans to build 1400 homes within the Julington-Durbin Preserve, in exchange for property on Black Hammock Island.</p> <p>In addition, the developer is now working with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to potentially sell the Black Hammock Island property to the state for conservation.</p> <p>While the Preserve appears to be safe for now, we cannot rest on our laurels. With the rapid growth that is occurring across the state and our watershed, there will only be more pressure in the future to develop our conservation lands.<br/>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>Let's celebrate for now, but remain vigilant in our efforts to safeguard our precious conservation lands, like Julington-Durbin. I hope to see you at the Celebration Rally on July 14!</p> <p>We need ALL OF YOU to show up to show your opposition to this scandulous land grab of one of our precious parks!</p> <p>Julington-Durbin Preserve is under threat! The developer who sold the land now wants to build 1,400 homes on 400 acres in the heart of the preserve.</p> <p>Join St. Johns Riverkeeper and partners (Florida Native Plant Society, Duval Audubon Society, Sierra Club Northeast Florida Group, League of Women Voters Jacksonville First Coast, Public Trust Law, and Fun 4 First Coast Kids) for a public rally and guided trail hikes.</p> <p>Let’s celebrate this special natural area and what we will lose if it is not preserved. Learn how you can take action and help us Save Julington-Durbin Preserve! #SaveJDPreserve</p> <p>Public Rally (9am)</p> <p>Post-Rally Guided Hikes:<br/>Native Plant Hike led by Florida Native Plant Society<br/>Native Bird Hike led by Duval Audubon Society<br/>Kids Nature Scavenger Hunt and Hike led by St. Johns Riverkeeper and Fun 4 First Coast Kids</p>",

We are starting at the planned site of the creek crossing and working back to the trailhead. Do photo forays to find and identify all the native plants in the area. Bring a smart phone along to do this. We're especially interested in finding native plants that are not easy to obtain from commercial sources. At the appropriate time for each species, gather seeds, cuttings, or transplants—whatever it takes to rescue that plant with the highest rate of success. Plant those seeds, cuttings, and transplants in other areas in the park, so their genetic background will remain available to the original locale. On any given date, we can do one, two, or all three of these activities, depending on the weather and your interests.</p> <p>Dress for the weather. Bring plenty of water.

            "description": "<p>• What we'll do<br/>JOIN THE MOVEMENT TO PROTECT OUR CHILDREN</p> <p>Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) is seeking volunteers to advocate for children who have been abused or neglected. On any given day, more than 350 children from Middlesex County are living in foster care. Now, more than ever, we need you. A child with a CASA is more likely to find a permanent home, spend less time in foster care, and perform better in school. Champion one of these children from your community and safeguard a child’s well being through advocacy in the court today. What does a CASA do? A CASA is integral in helping the Court in determining the appropriate permanent plan for the child. We ensure abuse and neglect doesn’t continue at the hand’s of the court. A CASA forges a connection with the child/children they are matched with. They build their trust and discover what their needs are. They examine their health and education records and meet with their caregivers, school, therapists and other professionals. Once they identify what the child’s needs are, they write a report and advocate for a child’s needs in court. Our staff and peer coordinators are with you every step of the way to support you and help you succeed. No special skills or specific backgrounds are needed. Advocates must be able to commit to volunteering about 6-8 hours a month, meet with the foster child they are assigned to at least once a month and commit to a case from start to finish, about 1 to 2 years. Training will start February 26th through March 29th. If you are interested in volunteering call (732)[masked], email [masked], or visit www.casaofmiddlesexcounty.org/volunteer for a volunteer application.</p> <p>• What to bring</p> <p>• Important to know</p>",

Hikers are given the tools and individualized support to reach out to their communities and raise vital funds for At The Crossroads, a nonprofit organization that works with homeless youth and young adults in San Francisco.</p> <p>There are many positions available throughout the day including:</p> <p><b>Office Volunteers (10+ vols) (both heavy lifting and low impact opportunities available) @ The Office</b> - Come spend a day in the office with the staff of ATC helping us prep the last of our hike supplies from about 10am-6pm. You don't have to stay the whole time, but if you could come by for any of it, that would be great! Some tasks will include: preparing the incentives and thank you bags, packing the vans, helping us prepare food, and organizing and labeling supplies.</p> <p><b>Food Runners (2 vols) (MUST HAVE CAR)</b> - Help ATC pick up food that our amazing sponsors have graciously donated to our hike. As a food runner, you will be exploring the urban landscape of San Francisco, as well as engaging with some fantastic restaurants and companies. If you are a foodie, this is the task for you. We would have volunteers waiting for you downstairs, so you could just drop off the goods and enjoy the rest of your day!</p> <p><b>Sign Placers (8-10 vols) (very physical) @ Mt. Tam</b> - Come spend a beautiful day on Mt. Tam helping us place signs for our hike. You would meet at Mt. Tam at 10 am and the sign placement should take about 4 hours. Armed with the expertise of a veteran sign placer, a handy GPS, and sign supplies, you will embark on the hike and place signs to ensure that our hikers won't get lost the next day. The GPS is preprogrammed with all of the sign placement locations. We are looking for about 10 volunteers who are able to trek up the mountain. You are more than welcome to invite friends to help out!</p> <p>Please call or email Sharissa Staples for volunteer placement: [masked] or tel:(415)[masked] x103.</p>",

Information will be provided to apply what is learned in your own garden, and there will be time to check in with question during every class.
